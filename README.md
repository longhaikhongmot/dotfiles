# tatsu does dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine and it works with both Mac OS and Linux.

## Setup

Quick setup:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tatsupro/dotfiles/main/setup.sh | sh
```

The script also can read the first argument from the command line to change the default remote dotfiles repository.
