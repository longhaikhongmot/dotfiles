# tatsu does dotfiles
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine and it works with both Mac OS and Arch Linux.

## Stuff I use
Not a lot, I'd like to keep my workflow minimal and efficient.
- Visual Studio Code: Main Text Editor
- NeoVim: Secondary Text Editor
- iTerm2: Main Terminal
- Zsh: Unix Shell
    - Powerlevel10k: Use to change PS1
    - zsh-autosuggestions: Fish-like Autocomplete
    - zsh-syntax-highlightings: Fish-like highlighting

## FAQ
**No Zsh plugin manager?** \
Why `oh-my-zsh` when you can simply source your plugin in `.zshrc`?

**Why VSCode?** \
I know it's electron but it's the only tool can get everything simple and right.
